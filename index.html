        <p>AASHKA!!</p>
        <p>I can’t believe you are already 17!! Omg throwback to the time when you were 16 and I was 16 and we both went on Junior dad adventures. JKJK Normally, I start off birthday letters by saying “woah i can’t believe you are already (insert age) i remember when…,” but I have not really know you for that long. Still, I am so grateful that we have become so close in the short amount of time of us being friends. Even though it was extracurriculars and classes like APES, Dhadkan, and Best Buddies that brought us together (the real MVP was B******* though), I am glad that our friendship exists beyond all that. You are funny (occasionally), cute, and so so sweet and I can not wait to make more memories with you. </p>
        <p>Hope your day goes great!</p>
